# RNA_Seq_pipeline-
fastq-(reads)-to-counts

This repository contains a basic RNA-Seq pipeline written in Bash. The pipeline performs quality control, trimming, alignment, and quantification of RNA-Seq reads.

## Tools Used
- [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) - Quality control
- [Trimmomatic](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic) - Read trimming
- [HISAT2](https://daehwankimlab.github.io/hisat2/) - Read alignment
- [Samtools](http://www.htslib.org/) - BAM sorting
- [Subread featureCounts](http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/featureCounts/) - Read 
   quantification.
